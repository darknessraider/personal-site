      <p>I am the soon-to-be programming lead of G3-Robotics FRC team 1648. I like writing low level embedded stuff and learning more about computers, but for some reason find myself making things like this. I am also a student at Midtown Highschool with almost a 4.0 GPA if not for my but Sophomore year Spanish teacher.</p>
